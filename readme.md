# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

These are my projects completed as part of the the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) course.

They are written in Python 2.7, using Jupyter Notebooks. My capstone project is using deep learning, Keras and Theano to automatically distinguish photos of cats from photos of dogs.

### Course Description

> Machine learning represents a key evolution in the fields of computer science, data analysis, software engineering, and artificial intelligence.
> This program will teach you how to become a machine learning engineer, and apply predictive models to massive data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and more.

### Projects

**P0: Titanic Survival Exploration**
> In this project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger’s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.

**P1: Predicting Boston House Prices**
> The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you’ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then used to estimate the best selling price for your client’s home.

**P2: Build a Student Intervention System**
> As education has grown to rely more and more on technology, more and more data is available for examination and prediction. Logs of student activities, grades, interactions with teachers and fellow students, and more are now available in real time. Educators are after new ways to predict success and failure early enough to stage effective interventions, as well as to identify the effectiveness of different interventions. Toward that end, our goal is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam.

**P3: Creating Customer Segments**
> A wholesale distributor recently tested a change to their delivery method for some customers, by moving from a morning delivery service five days a week to a cheaper evening delivery service three days a week.Initial testing did not discover any significant unsatisfactory results, so they implemented the cheaper option for all customers. Almost immediately, the distributor began getting complaints about the delivery service change and customers were canceling deliveries — losing the distributor more money than what was being saved. You’ve been hired by the wholesale distributor to find what types of customers they have to help them make better, more informed business decisions in the future. Your task is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.

**P4: Train a Smartcab to Drive**
> In the not-so-distant future, taxicab companies across the United States no longer employ human drivers to operate their fleet of vehicles. Instead, the taxicabs are operated by self-driving agents — known as smartcabs — to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate. In major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco, an increasing number of people have come to rely on smartcabs to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible. Although smartcabs have become the transport of choice, concerns have arose that a self-driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human drivers, particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles. To alleviate these concerns, your task as an employee for a national taxicab company is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved.

**P5: Capstone Project**
> In this capstone project, you will leverage what you’ve learned throughout the Nanodegree program to solve a problem of your choice by applying machine learning algorithms and techniques. You will first define the problem you want to solve and investigate potential solutions and performance metrics. Next, you will analyze the problem through visualizations and data exploration to have a better understanding of what algorithms and features are appropriate for solving it.

> You will then implement your algorithms and metrics of choice, documenting the preprocessing, refinement, and postprocessing steps along the way. Afterwards, you will collect results about the performance of the models used, visualize significant quantities, and validate/justify these values. Finally, you will construct conclusions about your results, and discuss whether your implementation adequately solves the problem.
