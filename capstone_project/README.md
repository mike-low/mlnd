### Capstone Project: "Dogs vs Cats Redux"

_Using Keras, Theano and deep learning to automaticlly distinguish images of dogs from those of cats._

### Setup

The dataset can be [downloaded here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mikelow-mlnd-capstone/vgg16_files.zip). After unzipping, it will create a /data/ directory that should be placed in the project root.

There are also three extra files that are too large for the GitHub repo, they can be [downloaded here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mikelow-mlnd-capstone/vgg16_files.zip).

 - vgg16_weights.h5 should be moved to /implementation/
 - vgg16_features_train.npy  should be moved to /implementation/vgg_new_top_layers/
 - vgg16_features_validation.npy should be moved to /implementation/vgg_new_top_layers/

### Running

The code itself is in self-contained Jupyter notebooks inside the /implementation/ folder
